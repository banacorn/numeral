\section{Introduction}

% Numbers are everywhere in our daily lives.

\subsection{What are numbers?}\label{num}

% Argue that what makes certain entity numbers from a structuralist perspective.

\subsection{Positional numeral systems}\label{pos}


\paragraph{Outline}
The remainder of the thesis is organized as follows.
% Section~\ref{agda} gives account of previous work.

\section{A gental introduction to dependently typed programming in Agda}\label{agda}

There are already plenty of tutorials and introductions of Agda\cite{norell2009dependently}.
Nonetheless, we will provide a simple and self-contained tutorial in this section,
covering the part (and only the part) we need in this work.

Some of the more advenced constructions (such as views and universes) used in
the following sections will be introduced along the way.

\subsection{Some basics}

\subsection{Dependent types}

\subsection{Simply typed programming in Agda}

\subsection{Dependently typed programming in Agda}


\section{Representing positional numeral systems}\label{representation}

\subsection{Bases}
\subsection{Offsets}
\subsection{Number of digits}

\section{Properties of Num}
\subsection{Categorizing Num}
\subsection{Views}

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}
