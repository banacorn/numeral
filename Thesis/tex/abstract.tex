% [draft]
Numbers are everywhere in our daily lives, and positional numeral systems are
arguably the most important and common representation of numbers. In this work
we have constructed a generalized positional numeral system in Agda to model many
of these representations, and investigate some of their properties and relationship
with the classical unary representation of the natural numbers.
