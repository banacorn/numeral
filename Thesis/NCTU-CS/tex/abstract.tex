\chapter*{Abstract}
Numbers are everywhere in our daily lives, and positional numeral systems are
arguably the most important and common representation of numbers.
In this work, we will investigate interesting properties and applications of
some variations of positional numeral systems and construct a generalized
positional numeral system to model and formalize them in Agda.
We will not only examine properties of our representation and its relationship
with the classical unary representation of natural numbers but also demonstrate
how to translate propositions and proofs between them.
